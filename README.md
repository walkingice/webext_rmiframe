# Introduction

This is a simple web-extension to help user remove any iframe from current page.

As a software developer, I fully understand lot of companies need advertisement to support their business. This is one reason I haven't install any ad-blocker. However, some of them put too much advertisements in just one page, and it cause very terrible user experience.

Usually these advertisements are provided in iframe, this web-extension helps you to remove iframe whenever you want. You can do it by

* Clicking a button
* Pressing a hot-key (Shift-Alt-i)
* Automatically

# Installation
